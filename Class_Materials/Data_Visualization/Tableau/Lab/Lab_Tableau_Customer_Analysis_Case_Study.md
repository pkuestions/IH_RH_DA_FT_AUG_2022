## Lab Tableau

Please repeat the Exploratory Data Analysis plotting part in the [Customer analysis Case Study](https://github.com/raafat-hantoush/IH_RH_DA_FT_AUG_2022/blob/main/Class_Materials/Case_Studies/Customer_Analysis_Case_Study/Activities.md) that you worked on in the previous labs.  The plotting part includes mainly Activity 4. This time will use Tableau instead of using python plotting libraries. 

(Optional) from Activity 3 , please using Tableau try to  <b>Plot the Correlation Heatmap</b>. You might find it easier to import the correlation matrix that you get from pandas as it is as csv file into Tableau.

Important:  Data csv file to be imported to Tableau can be found in this [Link](https://github.com/raafat-hantoush/IH_RH_DA_FT_AUG_2022/blob/main/Class_Materials/Case_Studies/Customer_Analysis_Case_Study/Data/Data_Marketing_Customer_Analysis_Round3.csv)
